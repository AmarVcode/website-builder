// Prompt:

Create a **Drag-and-Drop Website Builder Prototype using Angular**.

Requirements:
1. Use **Angular (latest stable version)** with **TypeScript** and **Angular CLI**.
2. Build a **sidebar** with draggable components: **Text, Image, Button**.
3. Implement a **canvas/workspace area** where users can **drop and position** these elements.
4. When an element is selected on the canvas, display a **properties form** to update its content:
   - Text: edit text content, font size, and color.
   - Image: edit image URL, width, and height.
   - Button: edit label and link URL.
5. Ensure the layout is **responsive** using **SCSS or Tailwind CSS**.
6. Use Angular-compatible **drag-and-drop library** such as `@angular/cdk/drag-drop`.
7. Use **Angular services** or **RxJS** for state management if needed.
8. Organize project with a modular structure: `/components`, `/services`, `/models`.
9. Pre-populate sidebar with a few default element types for demo.
10. Include a `README.md` or comment-based documentation that explains:
    - Tools & libraries used
    - Folder structure
    - How the app supports scalability (e.g., saving layout, more components)

Start by scaffolding an Angular app, installing required packages, and building the drag-drop layout structure.
